This is paramedic Smith. We are transporting a 36 year old male complaining of shortness of breath. He also complains of non-radiating sharp chest pain on expiration. Symptoms began 1 hour ago after exercising. He attempted to use his inhaler without relief. He does have a history of asthma. This patient was found with obvious respiratory difficulty. He is awake and appropriate. On exam we find lung sounds with wheezes in upper lobes bilaterally and quiet lower lobes bilaterally. Initial vital signs BP 162 over 94, pulse 124, respirations 36. Skin is warm and moist. Pulse oximetry 92% on 15 LPM by non-rebreather. ECG sinus tach without ectopy. We have treated with high-flow oxygen followed by one dose of Proventil and Atrovent by small volume nebulizer. The patient has improved and now has respirations of 24, slight wheezes in all fields. Pulse oximetry 96% on 6 LPM by nebulizer. We plan to begin a second dose of Proventil by nebulizer and transport to your ED. ETA is 7 minutes. Do you have any questions?
